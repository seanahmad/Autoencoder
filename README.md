# Autoencoder-LSTM


Autoencoder is usually used to do dimension reduction and feature extraction.   

The codes include:
1. How to build an autoencoder with recurrent neural network to do feature extraction
2. Used trigonometric functions to generate simple patterns of sequence data to train the model
